                                Success isn't always about greatness.                                                       Whenever you find yourself doubting how far you can go,
                                          It's about <mark>consistency</mark>.                                                                               just remember how far you have come.
                               Consistent hard work leads to success.                                              Remember everything you have faced, all the battles you have won,
                                            Greatness will come.                                                                                   and all the fears you have overcome.</pre>
